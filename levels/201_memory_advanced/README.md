# Level 201: Basic Advanced Monitoring
It's useful to know if you have hit the memory limit (including swap) or if you are swapping. We'll look at how to measure those here.

## Relevant Documentation
* [cgroup v1 Documentation Memory](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/memory.txt)

## Exercises
* Determine the number of swap events
* Determine the number of times the cgroup hits the memory limit

## How to check your work
You should see no swap events or 'hit memory limit' events
You should see memory utilization of about 80%
