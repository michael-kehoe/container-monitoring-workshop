# Level 300: IO Advanced
This will build upon levels 300 and 301. You will need to reimplement the same code, but extract the 95th percentile for all metrics.

## Exercises
* Determine the 95th percentile read and write Bits/ second of the container
* Determine the 95th percentile read and write IOPS of the container
* Determine the 95th percentile read and write bandwidth utilization (percentage) of the contaienr
* Determine the 95th percentile read and write IOPS utilization (percentage) of the container

## How to run the excercise

## How to check your work
Look at the output of your program and you should see an average CPU usage of 50%
